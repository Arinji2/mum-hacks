2024,The RTX 4070 Super provides a super performance bump for the price. I spent the week testing Nvidia's first 40-series Super card.,x
2024,I read a review of the INNO3D GeForce RTX 4070 Super Twin X2. It seems like a solid card based on what I saw.,x
2025,I read that the 12GB VRAM might be a limitation of the RTX 4070 SUPER. This is something that I am worried about.,x
2023,The GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition doesn't upend the graphics-card field. It is still a solid card for the price.,x
2024,The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super delivers a big performance upgrade for the same price as the RTX 4070.,x
2023,"The RTX 4070 is not as crap as other recent GPU launches. I think it is a good card, based on the reviews.",x
2025,"If price is similar, go for an RTX 4070. Also, NVidia GPUs have many advantages. It is a really good choice for its value.",quora
2024,RTX 4070 is also a big issue because it can't maximize itself in a low-TDP laptop chassis. 144Hz vs 240Hz also makes no difference because most.,quora
2023,"lol, that system is plenty fast for today's games. According to techpowerup's recent reviews of the RTX 40-series Super lineup, the RTX 4070 is great.",quora
2020,"Right now, I think the card I would choose is a RTX 3080, and I do not see much purpose in getting a 4000 generation CPU—unless the 4060/4070 is great.",quora
2023,The 4070 and 4070ti are not selling out. The same thing happened when Nvidia released their 20-series cards which prompted them to release the Super cards.,quora
2023,Nvidia cut the 4070 and 4060 on purpose to bait you on 4080 and 4090. 4070ti with 12gb of RAM is still better than the lower tier cards.,quora
2023,"Or go the other way and go with a 4070 or better (if Nvidia is a must have). I currently rock a 4070, just having updated from my 3060, and the improvement is amazing.",quora
2023,"Buying a slightly better value card at twice the price isn't always smarter, especially without need or income.",reddit
2023,"I upgraded to a 4080 because my computer is my passion, and I couldn't get a 4090.",reddit
2023,"My 2070 Super is getting old, but I don't know if the 4070 is worth the money.",reddit
2023,"The 40 series seems like a huge fail, so I think most people will wait for the 50 series.",reddit
2023,"The 4000 series GPUs below the 4090 aren't worth it, much like the 2000 series.",reddit
2025,"They are pushing everyone up in the price ladder, and you are paying 700 for 1/4 the card.",reddit
2024,"My 1070 needs a replacement, the 4070S looks very tempting, or maybe a 4070 price drop.",reddit
2024,"The 4070 is a more efficient 3080 with DLSS3.5 for a decent price, so not bad.",reddit
2024,Nvidia played this well by increasing prices and then launching better cards with better pricing.,reddit
