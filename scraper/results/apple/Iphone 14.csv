2022,The camera reviews are so different. People whose reviews I trust think the iPhone 14 Pro camera is great overall.,reddit
2022,The always-on display is too bright. Android phones have had better customization for years. It's a waste of potential.,reddit

2022,I upgraded and I'm loving the vanilla Android experience. The phone is warm and has few bugs I hope they fix soon.,reddit
2022,Video on iPhone is MUCH better than Pixel. Face unlock in low/poor lighting is TERRIBLE on the pixel.,reddit
2022,I went from iPhone 13 Pro to Pixel 7 Pro and I miss my longer battery life. Rest all is good though.,reddit
2022,Price to performance ratio the Pixel probably wins. If you can get along with iOS the iPhone 14 Pro is great.,reddit

2022,"I prefer Android, and always have done. IOS is too restrictive, but it is a slick package, that just works.",reddit
2022,Not worth switching to the Pixel. Switching cost is high and the experience is good but not good enough to make the swap.,reddit
2022,I would like Apple if the ecosystem wasn't so suffocating. I love my P7P and I am very disappointed with OnePlus 9 Pro.,reddit

2022,"Pixel is great for photos, but video and apps are better on iPhone. It sucks to spend $1K on a phone with problems.",reddit
2022,I stay with Pixel for its great shots. But I think their luck might run out if Apple goes for a periscope zoom.,reddit
2022,"Sure it takes great shots, but in well lit conditions so does cheaper Xiaomi. I’d rather have a phone that works well overall.",reddit
2022,Pictures of people don't always come out great on the Pixel 6. Skin tones can look darker than they look in real life.,reddit
