2022,apple,Iphone 14,reddit,The always-on display is too bright. Android phones have had better customization for years. It's a waste of potential.
2022,apple,Iphone 14,reddit,"I absolutely love this phone. Upgrading from the 12 Pro, the battery life is amazing, and the 120 hertz screen is noticeable."
2022,apple,Iphone 14,reddit,Dynamic Island forces interaction at the top of the screen. The 13 series has better bottom placement for screen interaction.

2022,apple,Iphone 14,reddit,"Pixel is great for photos, but video and apps are better on iPhone. It sucks to spend $1K on a phone with problems."
2022,apple,Iphone 14,reddit,I stay with Pixel for its great shots. But I think their luck might run out if Apple goes for a periscope zoom.
2022,apple,Iphone 14,reddit,"Sure it takes great shots, but in well lit conditions so does cheaper Xiaomi. I’d rather have a phone that works well overall."
2022,apple,Iphone 14,reddit,Pictures of people don't always come out great on the Pixel 6. Skin tones can look darker than they look in real life.
